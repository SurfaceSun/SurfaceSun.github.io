    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <p><li> My research is mainly focused on the safe navigation of sailing robots. The unmanned sailboat is a kind of surface robot driven only by the wind, with no noise, zero emissions, can survive for a long time. I am committed to ensuring the safe navigation of sailing robots for cost-effective, environmentally friendly, long-distance and long-duration ocean observation. A novel risk assessment strategy is proposed to show the regional distribution of sailing risk dynamically and in real time in view of the complex factors such as wind field, waves, tides and obstacles at sea. In addition, aiming at the problems of off-course, stall and even capsizing caused by the wake of surrounding vehicles, I modeled the wake and proposed and realized the avoidance strategy. All the above safety measures are verified by experiments on the real sea surface. As a core member of my research team, I have been devoted to the front line of ocean experiments for a long time, and strive to help promote the research of sailing robots.</p>
