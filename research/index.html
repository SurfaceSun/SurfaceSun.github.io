    <p><li><b>Accepted by T-RO: EeLsT: An Energy-efficient Long-short Term Approach for Sustainable Sailboat Autonomy in Disturbed Marine Environment.</b>
    Sailboats are purely wind-driven and thus have great potential in long-term voyaging. For robotic sailboats, constraints in the energy of the control boards, sensors, communication modules, and actuators are crucial for the sustainability of automation. Reducing the control frequency of actuators is crucial for energy conservation. This study proposes an energy-efficient long-short term (EeLsT) approach for sustainable sailing. In EeLsT, long-term and short-term observers are designed to adaptively take control decisions for time-varying environmental influences (e.g., waves and currents). It explicitly leverages the sailing motion characteristics and the dynamic model of the robot considering marine disturbances. In the real marine environment, experiments are conducted with OceanVoy, a catamaran sailing robot. The results show that 27.4% of the energy is saved during stable sailing. </p>

    <p><li><b>RA-L: V-stability based Control for Energy-saving towards Long Range Sailing.</b>
    Ensuring an adequate supply of energy is a challenge in the development of autonomous sailboats for long-range sailing capability, as the continuous highfrequency execution of control commands leads to high energy consumption. However, as the control of sailboat is much more complex than the other USVs, especially in a complicated and windy environment, simply reducing control frequency will lead to large path tracking error, and even unsuccessful navigation. Based on the V-stability controller of sailboats, this letter proposes an energy-saving (E-saving) control scheme for a sailboat, to enable the energy planning of actuators. While keeping the sailboat traveling within the acceptable range along a desired path, we develop an approach to analyze and reach a satisfying tradeoff between path tracking error and consumed energy. The E-saving method is examined in simulated environments and field experiments using an autonomous sailboat (OceanVoy). The results show that E-saving method reduces energy consumption by approximately 11% compared to that of the previous V-stability controller, indicating that our method can elongate sailing distance.</p>

    <p><li><b>IROS: OceanVoy: A Hybrid System for Energy Planning in Autonomous Sailboat.</b>
    Towards long range and high endurance sailing, energy is of utmost importance. Moreover, benefiting from the dominance of the sailboat itself, it is energy-saving and environment-friendly. Thus, the sailboat with energy planning problem is meaningful. However, until now, the sailboat energy optimization problem has rarely been considered. In this paper, we focus on the energy consumption optimization of an autonomous sailboat. It has been formulated as a Nonlinear Programming problem (NLP). We deal with it with a hybrid control scheme, in which pseudo-spectral (PS) optimal control method is used in heading control, and a model-free framework guided by Extreme Seeking Control (ESC) is used in sail control. The optimal path is generated with the optimal input motor torques in time series. As a result, both simulation and experiments have validated motion planning and energy planning performance. Notably, about 7% of energy is saved on average. Our proposed method can make sailboats sailing longer and sustainable.</p>

    <p><li><b>JMSE: Sailboat Test Arena (STAr): A Remotely Accessible Platform for Robotic Sailboat Research.</b>
    Autonomous sailing robots have attracted much attention, but challenges arise due to the sailing tests require an environment with both aerodynamic and hydrodynamic fields and a sufficient number of sailing robots in readiness. A remotely accessible platform with the advantages of low cost, easy operation and high efficiency is the preferred method to solve this dilemma. Consistent with this goal is the design of Sailboat Test Arena (STAr), a remotely accessible platform for sailing robot design verification, autonomous algorithms validation and sailing control practices. All three parts require extensive testing in real water environments. Hereby, for testers around the world, STAr can be accessed without time difference. A variety of local and remote tests have been conducted in the STAr platform at various location around the world. The results show that STAr is a remotely accessible and effective tool in data collection and skill transfer. With continuous adoption and optimization, STAr will continue to serve as a tool to further promote low-cost, high-efficiency and diverse sailing research, and provide opportunities for more people to experience sailing.</p>

    <p><li><b>Frontiers in Robotics and AI: Toward Long-Term Sailing Robots: State of the Art From Energy Perspectives.</b>
    Sailing robots can contribute significantly to maritime surface exploration, due to its potential for long-range and long-duration motions in the environment with abundant wind. However, energy, the critical factor for their long-term missions, shall be carefully investigated, so as to achieve sustainability in distance and time. In this survey, we have conducted a comprehensive investigation on numerous sailing robots, developed in academia and industry. Some of them have achieved long-term operation, and some are motivated by, but still on the way to this ambitious goal. Prototypes are grouped in each team, so as to view the development path. We further investigate the existing design and control strategies for energy sufficiency from three perspectives: actuation, harvesting, and energy management. In propulsion and steering, i.e., two major actuations, researchers have accumulated effective sail and rudder designs. The motorized propeller and wave-glider-inspired mechanism also contribute as compliments for propulsion. Electricity harvesting based on solar or wind energies is also discussed to gather more power from nature. Pros and cons in strategies of energy management, which are valuable tools to enhance power utilization efficiency, are elaborated. This article is hoped to provide researchers in long-term robotic sailing with a comprehensive reference from the perspectives of energy.</p>
