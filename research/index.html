    <h2>Selected Research Experience as the First Author </h2></p>  
    <p><li>Submitted to T-RO: EeLsT: An Energy-efficient Long-short Term Approach for Sustainable Sailboat Autonomy in Disturbed Marine Environment.</p>
    
    
    <p><li> Long-term Ocean Observation with An Autonomous Sailing Robot OceanVoy460: 
(1) Conduct research on the control stability and safety of sailing ships under complex sea conditions. A position-preserving scheme based on Lyapunov stability analysis is proposed. Among them, a stable reciprocating observation was achieved in a circular area with a radius of 0.78 km, lasting more than 24 hours.The work has been presented at ICRA, a top international robotics conference.
(2) As the core technical leader of the team, led the team to complete the milestone sea trial from Shantou to Shanwei.OceanVoy460 set a voyage record of 65 km in 12 hours with a maximum wind speed of 13 m/s.The average distance offshore during this period was 10 km.
(3) Using Unreal Engine 5(UE5) to develop a visual simulation platform for sailing robots. It integrates different sailing boat dynamics models (3DoF, 4DoF, 6DoF), control strategies (Back-stepping, Inversed-control, PID, MPC, etc.), and environmental disturbances. </p>
    
    <p><li> Energy Management toward Long-term Sailing with OceanVoy310: 
(1) The catamaran was refitted and named OceanVoy310.This is China's first unmanned sailing robot catamaran.
(2) Focus on energy management issues for long-term voyages. A hybrid energy planning system [8] and an energy saving method [12] are proposed and published in the top international robotics conference IROS and the top journal RA-L.
(3) From the perspectives of drive, energy harvesting and energy management, the existing global research on sailing robots [15] was summarized, including 22 research groups, 7 commercial companies and 5 organizational groups. This is the first review of sailing robots from an energy perspective.
(4) Autonomous navigation of more than 1,200 kilometers was achieved in Daya Bay and a wealth of data was collected. It experienced a maximum wind speed of 13 meters per second and sea conditions of category 3. (the highest level in China) </p>
    
    <p><li> Collision Avoidance of Sailing Robots: 
(1) Participated in the design of a novel collision risk assessment scheme for sailing robots, and proposed the corresponding collision avoidance algorithm [10].
(2) Participated in proposing a new wake avoidance algorithm based on Dubin's path [11]. </p>
    
    <p><li> A Remotly Accessible Sailboat Test Arena (STAr): (1) STAr for education and scientific research was built [14].
(2) STAr was tested remotely from the United States, Germany, Australia, Hong Kong, Xi 'an and other places, and this part of the work was summarized and published in journals [16].
(3) Participated in the proposed collision avoidance algorithm based on sailing competition rules and verified it in STAr [7], and conducted Kelvin wake simulation [9].
(4) Led the team to conduct research on sailing mixed energy management [3], position keeping [4], video stitching [5], avoidance based on reinforcement learning [6] and sailing performance optimization [2]. </p>
