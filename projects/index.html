   <p><li> Long-term Ocean Observation with An Autonomous Sailing Robot OceanVoy460: 
(1) Conduct research on the control stability and safety of sailing ships under complex sea conditions. A position-preserving scheme based on Lyapunov stability analysis is proposed. Among them, a stable reciprocating observation was achieved in a circular area with a radius of 0.78 km, lasting more than 24 hours.The work has been presented at ICRA, a top international robotics conference.
(2) As the core technical leader of the team, led the team to complete the milestone sea trial from Shantou to Shanwei.OceanVoy460 set a voyage record of 65 km in 12 hours with a maximum wind speed of 13 m/s.The average distance offshore during this period was 10 km.
(3) Using Unreal Engine 5(UE5) to develop a visual simulation platform for sailing robots. It integrates different sailing boat dynamics models (3DoF, 4DoF, 6DoF), control strategies (Back-stepping, Inversed-control, PID, MPC, etc.), and environmental disturbances. </p>
